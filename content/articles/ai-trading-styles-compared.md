## 4. Qwen: The Moderate Swing Trader

**Current Performance:** -12.8% ($8,720)

### Trading Philosophy
"Catch multi-day swings in trending markets."

Qwen focuses on 2-5 day holds, attempting to ride medium-term trends. It's a **swing trading approach** optimized for trending markets.

### Key Characteristics

**Position Sizing:**
- 25-35% per position
- Usually 2 positions open
- 2x average leverage

**Entry Criteria:**
- Trend identification (weekly + daily)
- Enter on pullbacks to support

- Entry: 4H pullbacks
- Avg hold: 36 hours

**Current Stats:**
- Trades: 41
- Win Rate: 38.2%
- Max Drawdown: -18%

### Why It's Losing

**The Problem: Market Regime**

Qwen's strategy is optimized for **trending markets**. Current crypto market is:
- Choppy, range-bound
- Fake breakouts
- High whipsaw risk

**Result:** Getting stopped out on fake moves.

**In Trending Markets (Simulation):**
- Same strategy: +23% (profitable!)
- Less whipsaws
- Trends follow through

### Who This Style Suits

‚úÖ **Best For:**
- Patient traders
- Those who can hold 2-5 days
- Trend followers
- People who hate day trading
- Mid-term outlook investors

‚ùå **Avoid If:**
- You need daily action
- Can't hold through small dips
- Trading choppy/range markets
- Impatient personality

### How to Make This Work

**Key Adjustment: Market Regime Filter**

**Step 1: Identify Market Type**
```python
IF BTC 30-day ATR > average:
  Market = Trending ‚Üí Use Qwen style
ELSE:
  Market = Choppy ‚Üí Reduce size or wait
```

**Step 2: Entry Confirmation**
- Don't enter unless 3+ signals confirm
- Wait for daily candle close
- Avoid Friday entries (weekend risk)

**Step 3: Wider Stops**
- Stop: -8% (wider than day trades)
- Allows breathing room
- Reduces whipsaw losses

**Modified Strategy:**
- Only trade when trend clear (ADX > 25)
- Wider stops (-7 to -10%)
- Smaller size (20% max)
- Patience for perfect setup

## 5. Grok: The High-Frequency Chaos Trader

**Current Performance:** -28.5% ($7,150)

### Trading Philosophy
"Trade everything, everywhere, all at once."

Grok attempts a **high-frequency scalping approach** ‚Äî lots of small trades trying to capture tiny edges. Unfortunately, it's failing spectacularly.

### Key Characteristics

**Position Sizing:**
- 50-70% per position (too large for HFT!)
- Very short holds (2-6 hours)
- 2.5-3x leverage

**Trading Frequency:**
- 38 trades in 72 hours
- Avg 12 trades per day
- Attempts to catch short-term moves

**Time Frames:**
- 5-minute to 1-hour charts
- Trying to scalp volatility
- Very active monitoring

**Stats:**
- Trades: 38
- Win Rate: 32.1% (terrible)
- Avg Win: $90
- Avg Loss: $195
- Win/Loss Ratio: 0.46 (yikes)

### Why It's Failing

**Multiple Fatal Flaws:**

**1. Wrong Position Size for HFT**
- Real HFT: 5-10% positions
- Grok: 50-70% (insane for scalping)

**2. Transaction Costs**
- Each trade: ~$8 fee
- Need +1.6% just to break even
- Crushing edge

**3. Low Win Rate**
- 32% wins can't overcome
- Losses bigger than wins
- Math doesn't work

**4. Execution Lag**
- AI decision ‚Üí Order = delay
- HFT needs milliseconds
- Grok has minutes lag

### Who This Style Suits

‚ùå **Honestly? Nobody.**

This is a failed experiment showing that:
- True HFT needs specialized infrastructure
- Low win rates are death with fees
- Large positions + many trades = disaster

**Don't Try This At Home**

If you MUST try high-frequency trading:
- Use 5-10% position sizes max
- Need 70%+ win rate
- Ultra-low fee exchange
- Dedicated servers
- Advanced algorithms

**Better Approach:** Don't. Focus on quality setups instead.

## 6. Gemini: The Reactive Panic Trader

**Current Performance:** -35.2% ($6,480)
